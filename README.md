# Goal by Goal

Welcome to the information portal for Goal by Goal, an iOS app for checking NHL scores.

This GitHub repository is intended to serve two purposes:

1. To provide general information about the app, such as the Terms of Use (ToU) as well as the Privacy Policy
2. To act as a bug and issue tracker for the app, so users can report anything they've encountered and see what other people have reported

## Reporting bugs

To report a bug through here, you'll need a GitHub account. You can create one [here](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already. Then, click the "Issues" tab at the top, click the green "New" button, give it a title, and fill in the form describing the issue you're seeing. 

If possible, include steps to reproduce the issue (it's more difficult to fix if we can't reproduce it ourselves, but sometimes this isn't always possible), and any other information that you think might be helpful, like a video, GIF, or screenshot. The more information, the better.

It's possible that the issue you're encountering has already been reported by someone else or is already a known issue, so take a look to see if there's anything similar before submitting a new issue. 

If you prefer not to create a GitHub account, you can send us an email by clicking [here](mailto:goalbygoal.app@gmail.com).
